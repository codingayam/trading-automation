# Group 02: API Clients & Data Layer
**Priority**: Core Components - Can start after Group 01 database setup
**Estimated Effort**: High complexity, 4-5 developer-days total
**Dependencies**: Requires database schema and configuration from Group 01

## Rationale for Grouping
These API integration tasks can be developed in parallel once the database foundation is ready. Each API client can be developed independently since they have different responsibilities and interfaces. The data processing logic is shared between agents but can be developed alongside the API clients.

## Tasks in This Group (Can be developed in parallel)

- API error handling and recovery procedures

### Task 2.3: yfinance Integration & Market Data Service
**Owner**: Backend Developer C  
**Effort**: 1 developer-day
**Description**: Implement yfinance integration for supplementary market data and return calculations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Create `MarketDataService` class wrapping yfinance functionality
- Implement current price fetching with caching (15-minute cache)
- Add historical price data for "since open" return calculations
- Handle ticker symbol validation and error cases
- Implement dividend and split adjustment handling

**Deliverables**:
- `src/data/market_data_service.py` with price data integration
- Return calculation utilities (`src/utils/calculations.py`)
- Price data caching mechanism
- Market hours and holiday handling
- Unit tests for all price data scenarios

### Task 2.4: Data Processing Engine
**Owner**: Backend Developer A or C (parallel with their API client work)
**Effort**: 1 developer-day  
**Description**: Create unified data processing engine that orchestrates all API integrations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Create `DataProcessor` class that coordinates API calls
- Implement daily data fetching workflow (9:30 PM EST trigger)
- Add data validation and consistency checks across APIs
- Create transaction processing pipeline (fetch → filter → validate → store)
- Implement portfolio synchronization between Alpaca and database
- Add performance metrics calculation and storage
- Create data reconciliation procedures
- Handle partial failure scenarios gracefully
- Add comprehensive logging for all data operations
- Implement data backup and recovery procedures
- Create database transaction management for atomic operations

**Deliverables**:
- `src/data/data_processor.py` with orchestration logic
- Daily processing workflow implementation
- Data validation and reconciliation procedures
- Transaction management for atomic operations
- Integration tests with all three API clients
- Processing pipeline documentation

## Integration Points with Other Groups
- **Group 01**: Requires database schema, configuration, and error handling framework
- **Group 03**: Provides data processing engine and API clients that trading agents will use
- **Group 04**: Provides market data service and calculation utilities for dashboard
- **Group 05**: Integration tests will validate API client functionality

## Parallel Development Strategy
These tasks can be developed simultaneously after Group 01 completion:
- Developer A: Quiver API Client (1.5 days) → Data Processing Engine (1 day)
- Developer B: Alpaca API Client (2 days) → Integration support (0.5 days)  
- Developer C: yfinance Integration (1 day) → Data Processing Engine support (0.5 days)

## Success Criteria
- All three API clients successfully authenticate and fetch data
- Quiver client can retrieve congressional trading data with proper filtering
- Alpaca client can place orders and fetch positions in paper trading mode
- yfinance integration provides accurate price data with caching
- Data processing engine orchestrates all APIs without data loss
- Error handling gracefully manages API failures and retries
- All API responses are properly logged and stored for audit
- Performance metrics show API calls complete within acceptable timeframes

## Technical Considerations
- **Rate Limiting**: Each API has different rate limits requiring specific handling
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure timestamps and data alignment across different APIs
- **Error Recovery**: API failures should not corrupt database state
- **Testing**: Mock all external API calls for reliable unit testing
- **Security**: All API keys managed through secure configuration system
- **Performance**: Consider async/concurrent API calls where appropriate

## Risk Mitigation
- **API Changes**: Version all API integrations and monitor for deprecations
- **Rate Limits**: Implement generous retry delays and monitor usage patterns
- **Data Quality**: Validate all incoming data before database storage
- **Authentication**: Handle token refresh and authentication failures gracefully

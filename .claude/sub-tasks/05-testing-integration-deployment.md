# Group 05: Testing, Integration & Deployment
**Priority**: Quality Assurance & Launch - Begins after Groups 01-04 are substantially complete
**Estimated Effort**: Medium-High complexity, 4-5 developer-days total
**Dependencies**: Requires completion of all other groups for full integration testing

## Rationale for Grouping
This group focuses on comprehensive testing, system integration, and deployment preparation. While some testing can be done in parallel with development (unit tests within each group), integration testing and deployment require most components to be functional. These tasks ensure system reliability and production readiness.

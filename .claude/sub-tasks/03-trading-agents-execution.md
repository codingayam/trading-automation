# Group 03: Trading Agents & Execution Logic
**Priority**: Core Business Logic - Can start after Group 02 API clients are functional
**Estimated Effort**: Medium complexity, 3-4 developer-days total
**Dependencies**: Requires API clients and data processing from Group 02

## Rationale for Grouping
Trading agent implementation can be parallelized since all agents follow the same pattern but track different politicians. The base agent framework can be developed first, then individual agents can be implemented in parallel. The scheduler can be developed independently once the agent interface is defined.

## Tasks in This Group

### Task 3.1: Base Agent Framework
**Owner**: Senior Backend Developer
**Effort**: 1.5 developer-days
**Description**: Create the foundational agent architecture that all trading agents will inherit from

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Create abstract `BaseAgent` class defining the agent interface:
  ```python
  class BaseAgent:
      def __init__(self, agent_id: str, config: dict)
      def process_trades(self, congressional_data: List[dict]) -> List[dict]
      def execute_trade(self, trade_decision: dict) -> bool
      def update_positions(self) -> None
      def calculate_performance(self) -> dict
  ```
- Implement "copy trading" strategy logic (buy when politician buys >$50k)
- Add trade size calculation logic (minimum 1 share or $100)
- Create position management and portfolio tracking
- Implement trade decision logging and audit trail
- Add performance metrics calculation (daily return, total return)

### Task 3.3: Transportation Committee Agent
**Owner**: Backend Developer B  
**Effort**: 0.5 developer-days

- Configure multiple politician name matching for Transportation & Infrastructure Committee
- Implement committee member list management
- Add logic to handle multiple politicians in single trade decisions
- Create committee-specific performance aggregation
- Configure fuzzy name matching for all committee members
- Add committee membership configuration management

**Deliverables**:
- `src/agents/committee_agent.py` with multi-politician tracking
- Transportation Committee member configuration
- Committee-specific performance calculations  
- Unit tests for committee member matching
- Committee agent documentation

### Task 3.4: Agent Registration & Factory System
**Owner**: Senior Backend Developer (parallel with base agent work)
**Effort**: 0.5 developer-days
**Description**: Create agent registration and factory system for dynamic agent management

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Create `AgentFactory` class for dynamic agent creation
- Implement agent registration system with configuration-driven setup
- Add agent discovery and initialization from config files
- Create agent lifecycle management (start, stop, status)
- Implement agent health checks and status monitoring
- Add agent configuration validation and error handling
- Create agent metrics collection and reporting
- Support adding new agents without code changes

**Deliverables**:
- `src/agents/agent_factory.py` with dynamic agent creation
- Agent registration and discovery system
- Agent lifecycle management utilities
- Configuration-driven agent setup
- Agent monitoring and health checks

### Task 3.5: Daily Execution Scheduler
**Owner**: Backend Developer C
**Effort**: 1 developer-day
**Description**: Implement the daily execution scheduler that runs all agents at 9:30 PM EST

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Create `DailyRunner` class that orchestrates daily execution
- Implement 9:30 PM EST scheduling with timezone handling
- Add execution workflow:
  1. Fetch congressional data via data processor
  2. Run all agents in parallel/sequence
  3. Update positions and calculate performance
  4. Generate execution summary and notifications
- Handle execution failures and partial completions gracefully
- Implement execution logging and monitoring
- Add manual execution triggers for testing
- Create execution status tracking and reporting
- Handle market holidays and weekend scheduling
- Add execution retry logic for failed runs

**Deliverables**:
- `src/scheduler/daily_runner.py` with complete scheduling logic
- Cron job configuration for automated execution
- Manual execution scripts for testing
- Execution monitoring and logging
- Scheduler configuration and timezone handling
- Integration with system cron or Python scheduling

## Integration Points with Other Groups
- **Group 02**: Requires functional API clients and data processing engine
- **Group 04**: Provides agent performance data and portfolio information for dashboard
- **Group 05**: Scheduler and agents will be tested in integration testing

## Parallel Development Strategy
After base agent framework is defined (first 1.5 days):
- Developer A: Individual agents implementation (1 day)
- Developer B: Committee agent implementation (0.5 days) + Integration support (0.5 days)
- Developer C: Daily scheduler (1 day)
- Senior Developer: Agent factory system (0.5 days) + Integration oversight (0.5 days)

## Success Criteria
- All 5 agents successfully instantiate and run without errors
- Base agent framework provides consistent interface for all agent types
- Agents correctly identify and process congressional trades based on politician matching
- Trade execution successfully places orders through Alpaca API
- Position tracking accurately reflects current portfolio state
- Performance calculations provide accurate daily and total returns
- Daily scheduler executes all agents at correct time with proper error handling
- Agent factory system allows for easy addition of new agents
- Complete audit trail exists for all agent decisions and trade executions

## Technical Considerations
- **Concurrency**: Consider parallel agent execution for improved performance
- **State Management**: Ensure agent state consistency across executions
- **Error Recovery**: Agent failures should not affect other agents
- **Resource Management**: Monitor memory and database connection usage
- **Configuration**: Support environment-specific agent configurations
- **Scalability**: Design for easy addition of new agents and politicians

## Risk Mitigation
- **Trade Execution**: Implement comprehensive order validation before placement
- **Data Quality**: Validate congressional data before agent processing
- **Performance**: Monitor agent execution times and optimize bottlenecks
- **Reliability**: Ensure scheduler handles system restarts and failures
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all agent decisions for compliance

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each agent with mock congressional data
- Integration tests with actual API clients using test data
- End-to-end tests of complete daily execution workflow
- Performance tests to ensure agents execute within time constraints
- Error scenario testing for various failure conditions

# Triage Report: Railway Health Check Failure

## Summary
- **Symptom**: Railway deployment failing with "1/1 replicas never became healthy! Healthcheck failed!" 
- **Scope/Blast Radius**: Complete deployment failure - Railway service cannot start successfully
- **First Seen / Last Known Good**: Recent issue, potentially after commit d249a8d (health server port fix)
- **Environments Affected**: Railway production environment only
- **Related Tickets/Deploys/Flags**: Recent commits show multiple health check fixes and Railway deployment issues

## Likely Components & Paths
- **Primary Subsystem**: Railway deployment infrastructure → Docker health check mechanism
- **Secondary Subsystem**: Flask dashboard health endpoint → HTTP server initialization
- **Candidate paths**:
  - `/Users/admin/github/trading-automation/railway_runner.py` - Main Railway entry point
  - `/Users/admin/github/trading-automation/Dockerfile.railway` - Docker health check configuration
  - `/Users/admin/github/trading-automation/src/dashboard/api.py` - Health endpoints (/health, /api/health)
  - `/Users/admin/github/trading-automation/deployment/railway/supervisord.conf` - Process management
  - `/Users/admin/github/trading-automation/src/utils/health.py` - Health checking infrastructure

## Ranked Hypotheses

1) **Missing Railway PORT Environment Variable** — Confidence: 85
   - **Mechanism**: Railway doesn't set `PORT` env var, dashboard defaults to port 5000, health check tries wrong port
   - **Evidence for**: Railway vars output shows no `PORT` variable; Dockerfile health check uses `$PORT` 
   - **Evidence against**: Code defaults to port 5000 when PORT is missing
   - **Quick validation**: Check if Railway assigned a PORT, verify health check URL matches actual binding
   - **Expected observation if true**: Health check hitting wrong port, connection refused/timeout

2) **Docker Health Check Timing Issues** — Confidence: 75  
   - **Mechanism**: Flask app takes >30 seconds to start, exceeds health check start period
   - **Evidence for**: Complex initialization (database, agents, threading), 30s start period may be insufficient
   - **Evidence against**: Logs show successful initialization completing quickly
   - **Quick validation**: Check actual startup time vs health check timing
   - **Expected observation if true**: Health check firing before Flask is ready to respond

3) **Dashboard Thread Startup Race Condition** — Confidence: 65
   - **Mechanism**: Dashboard thread marked as daemon=True, may not be fully initialized when health check fires
   - **Evidence for**: Multi-threaded startup with daemon threads in railway_runner.py
   - **Evidence against**: Logs show "Dashboard thread started" message
   - **Quick validation**: Add health check delay or ensure Flask binding completion
   - **Expected observation if true**: Intermittent health check failures, timing-dependent

4) **Supervisord Process Management Issues** — Confidence: 45
   - **Mechanism**: Supervisord launching railway_runner.py but health check hitting supervisor instead of Flask
   - **Evidence for**: Using supervisord wrapper, potential port confusion
   - **Evidence against**: Clean supervisord configuration, process delegation seems correct
   - **Quick validation**: Test direct railway_runner.py execution vs supervisord
   - **Expected observation if true**: Health check reaching wrong process/port

5) **Flask App Factory Pattern Issues** — Confidence: 35
   - **Mechanism**: create_app() not properly registering health routes or Flask context issues
   - **Evidence for**: Uses application factory pattern, potential route registration timing
   - **Evidence against**: Routes are defined at module level, should be registered
   - **Quick validation**: Test /health endpoint locally with same configuration  
   - **Expected observation if true**: 404 errors on health endpoint

## High-Signal Checks (Do First)
- [ ] **Check Railway PORT assignment**: `railway logs` during startup to see if PORT is dynamically assigned
- [ ] **Verify health endpoint accessibility**: Test if https://trading-automation-production.up.railway.app/health responds
- [ ] **Check Docker health check timing**: Review if 30s start period is sufficient for Flask initialization
- [ ] **Test local Railway simulation**: Run `PORT=5000 python3 railway_runner.py` and curl http://localhost:5000/health

## Recent Changes (last 20 commits touching suspects)
- d249a8d — src/utils/health.py — Fix Railway health server port conflict (skip health server in Railway) — Recent
- dcac400 — Multiple files — Update health monitoring and logging system — Recent  
- d12b2bd — Unknown — Force Railway redeploy to verify scheduler fix — Recent
- 87d0488 — Multiple files — Fix critical Railway scheduler process lifecycle issue — Recent

## Data Gaps & Requests
- **Need**: Current Railway PORT assignment during deployment (`railway logs` during container startup)
- **Need**: Health check response details (HTTP status, response body, timing)
- **Need**: Flask binding confirmation (host/port actual vs expected)
- **Need**: Container startup sequence timing (supervisord → railway_runner → Flask initialization)

## Handoff to Debugger subagent
- **Start with**: `/Users/admin/github/trading-automation/Dockerfile.railway` line 43-44 (health check configuration)
- **Try to falsify Hypothesis #1 via**: Check Railway logs for PORT environment variable assignment and verify if health check URL matches Flask binding
- **If falsified**: Proceed to #2 (timing issues) by testing health check with longer start period
- **If confirmed**: Fix health check to use correct port or ensure PORT is properly set by Railway

**Next Steps**: 
1. Get Railway deployment logs to see PORT assignment
2. Test health endpoint directly via Railway domain  
3. If health endpoint accessible, issue is Docker health check configuration
4. If health endpoint not accessible, issue is Flask startup/binding

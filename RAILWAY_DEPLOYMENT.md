# Railway Deployment Guide ðŸš€

Deploy your trading automation system to Railway with a simplified all-in-one setup.

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy from GitHub Repository
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Connect your GitHub account if needed
5. Select your repository: `codingayam/trading-automation`
6. Choose the **main** branch
7. Railway will automatically detect `Dockerfile.railway` and start building

### 2. Database Configuration
The system uses SQLite database with persistent file storage.
No additional database service required - SQLite files are stored on the Railway volume.

### 3. Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard â†’ your app service â†’ **Variables** tab:

**Required:**
```
ENVIRONMENT=production
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_key_here
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret_here
ALPACA_PAPER=true
QUIVER_API_KEY=your_quiver_key_here
```

**Optional:**
```
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### 4. Configure Daily Execution
Use Railway Cron to trigger the congressional copy-trading workflow once per day:

1. Open **Cron Jobs** â†’ **New Job**
2. Set schedule to `30 01 * * *` (01:30 UTC = 9:30â€¯PM ET)
3. Command: `python main.py run-once`
4. Select the same service/environment and save

_Repo includes `railway.toml` with the same schedule. If you prefer config-as-code, run `railway up --prompt crons` after deploying and Railway will sync the cron from that file._

Railway will continue to:
- Build using `Dockerfile.railway`
- Run the always-on dashboard service
- Redeploy whenever you push to GitHub

That's it! Your dashboard is live and trading runs nightly via Cron. ðŸŽ‰

## What Gets Deployed

The simplified Railway deployment includes:

### âœ… Dashboard Service (Always On)
- Runs the Flask dashboard + APIs
- Provides visibility into agent performance and holdings
- Serves health checks for Railway

### âœ… Daily Trading Job (Railway Cron)
- Executes `python main.py run-once`
- Pulls Quiver data and runs agent workflows at 9:30â€¯PM ET
- Places GTC orders via Alpaca in a single pass

### âœ… Health Monitoring
- Health check endpoint at `/health`
- Automatic restart on failure
- Process monitoring via Supervisor

## Database Configuration

### SQLite with Persistent Storage
The system uses SQLite database stored on Railway volume:
- **File-based** - no separate database service needed
- **Persistent** - data survives deployments
- **Zero cost** - included with app service
- **Automatic** - no configuration required

## Service Architecture

```
Railway Service (Single Container)
â”œâ”€â”€ Supervisor (process manager)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dashboard & API (Flask)
â”œâ”€â”€ SQLite Database (persistent volume)
â””â”€â”€ Health Check Endpoint

Railway Cron Job (managed by Railway)
â””â”€â”€ python main.py run-once  # nightly trading workflow
```

## Cost Estimate

- **App Service**: ~$5/month (minimal usage)
- **Database**: $0 (SQLite included)
- **Total**: ~$5/month

## Monitoring & Logs

### View Logs
```bash
railway logs
```

### Service Status
```bash
railway status
```

### Dashboard Access
Your dashboard will be available at:
`https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Yes | `production` | Environment mode |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | Auto | `data/trading_automation.db` | SQLite database file path |
| `ALPACA_API_KEY` | Yes | - | Alpaca trading API key |
| `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY` | Yes | - | Alpaca trading secret |
| `ALPACA_PAPER` | No | `true` | Use paper trading |
| `QUIVER_API_KEY` | Yes | - | Quiver congressional data API |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `INFO` | Logging level |

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --build

# Common fixes:
# 1. Ensure all files are committed to git
# 2. Check Dockerfile.railway exists
# 3. Verify requirements.txt is complete
```

### Service Won't Start
```bash
# Check runtime logs
railway logs

# Common issues:
# 1. Missing environment variables
# 2. Database connection issues
# 3. Port configuration problems
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL is set
railway variables

# Check PostgreSQL service status
railway status
```

### Health Check Failures
The health check hits `/health` endpoint. If failing:
1. Check if dashboard service is running
2. Verify supervisor configuration
3. Check application logs

## Scaling & Performance

### Single Service Setup
- **Pros**: Simple, cost-effective, easy to manage
- **Cons**: Limited scalability, shared resources
- **Best for**: Personal use, small portfolios

### When to Consider Multi-Service
Scale to multiple services when you need:
- High availability
- Resource isolation
- Multiple environments
- Complex monitoring

## Security Notes

1. **Paper Trading**: Always start with `ALPACA_PAPER=true`
2. **API Keys**: Never commit keys to git
3. **Environment Variables**: Set sensitive data via Railway dashboard
4. **Database**: Railway PostgreSQL includes SSL by default

## Next Steps

After deployment:

1. **Verify Health**: Check `https://your-app.up.railway.app/health`
2. **View Dashboard**: Browse to your Railway URL
3. **Monitor Logs**: Use `railway logs` to watch execution
4. **Test Trading**: Ensure paper trading works before going live

## Support

- **Railway Issues**: [Railway Help Center](https://help.railway.app/)
- **App Issues**: Check application logs with `railway logs`
- **Trading Issues**: Verify API keys and paper trading mode

ðŸŽ¯ **Your trading automation system is now running in the cloud!** 

The system will execute all agents together during market hours (9:30 AM ET) and you can monitor everything through the web dashboard.
